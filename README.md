## About Me:
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mikel Navas, and I am currently a senior at Florida Gulf Coast University, set to graduate in December with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Data Analytics and Informatics. This portfolio showcases my projects, which primarily focus on data cleaning, manipulation, exploration, and visualization. The tools I have utilized for these projects include MS SQL Server, Power BI, Python, and Excel.

## Projects
### Exploratory Analysis and Visualization of Education Data using MS SQL Server and PowerBI
Intro: The data used in the project is a sample dataset found on kaggle. The first step was importing the flat file into SQL Server and correcting the data types of each column. After Verifying that there aren't any Duplicate records or null values, the next step is exploratory analysis. As a student i have an idea of some of the metrics that a school might value, such as GPA, absences, and study time.
